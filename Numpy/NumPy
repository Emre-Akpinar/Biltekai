What is NumPy?
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library designed for numerical computations in Python. It provides essential tools for working with large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. Whether you’re a data scientist, engineer, or researcher, NumPy is a crucial component of your toolkit.

Key Features of NumPy
Arrays and Data Structures:
NumPy’s core data structure is the n-dimensional array (ndarray). These arrays allow efficient storage and manipulation of data.
Arrays can have any number of dimensions (1D, 2D, 3D, etc.), making them suitable for representing vectors, matrices, and tensors.

Mathematical Functions and Operations:
NumPy provides an extensive collection of mathematical functions:

Basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)

Trigonometry (sine, cosine, tangent)

Exponential and logarithmic functions

Linear algebra operations (dot product, matrix inversion, eigenvalues)

Statistical functions (mean, median, standard deviation)

These functions operate element-wise on arrays, making complex computations straightforward.

Broadcasting:
Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays with different shapes.
When operating on arrays of different sizes, NumPy automatically broadcasts the smaller array to match the shape of the larger one.

Indexing and Slicing:
NumPy arrays support powerful indexing and slicing capabilities.
You can extract specific elements, rows, or columns easily.

Random Number Generation:
NumPy includes functions for generating random data:
Uniform distributions
Normal distributions
Random integers
Useful for simulations, testing, and modeling.

Efficient Memory Management:
NumPy optimizes memory usage and provides efficient array storage.
Unlike Python lists, NumPy arrays are contiguous in memory, improving performance.

Installation
To get started with NumPy, install it using either pip or conda:

pip install numpy
# or
conda install numpy

Basic Usage
Python:

import numpy as np

# Create an array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Operations
mean_value = np.mean(arr)
sum_value = np.sum(arr)

print(f"Mean: {mean_value}, Sum: {sum_value}")
